# First Department

🕊 Russian Human Rights Initiative.

We stand for:

🌍 Freedom of information

🌚 Reducing secrecy

📱 Digital Rights

The First Department (Первый отдел) is a community of lawyers and journalists fighting against government secrecy. We open the doors of closed court sessions, unearth illegally classified data from archives, and defend citizens unfairly accused of crimes against the state.

Why "The First Department"? It's quite simple.

The First Department of the FSB's Investigative Directorate handles criminal cases involving treason and espionage. The First Departments in courts oversee the proceedings of such cases. The First Departments in enterprises deal with the classification of documents and the keeping of secrets. Human Rights Initiative "The First Department" fights to ensure that the employees of all First Departments in the country comply with the laws of the Russian Federation.

They close and imprison, we open and liberate.

🎥 [Favorite Software of Border Guards for Hacking Your Phones](https://youtu.be/Ib4jFJrrgu8)

Russian security forces are adept at hacking mobile devices and extracting virtually any data, including personal messages from most messengers. All they need is access to your phone for a couple of hours, and even relatively new devices, released just last year, aren't safe from this attack.

The secret to their success lies in the Israeli forensic suites Cellebrite UFED and their Russian-American counterpart, "Mobile Forensic." Every border checkpoint is equipped with these tools, and anyone can operate them — the hacking process is fully automated and requires no special skills.

In this video, you'll find the most comprehensive review of forensic software for special services in Russian.

🔓 [“Maps, Wagner, and Two Hacked Computers”: How a Sysadmin from Kuban Outsmarted the FSB (and Stayed Free)](https://youtu.be/FVSuB49vJNc)

Russian hackers, the Wagner Group, recruitment, and state treason. These elements intertwine in the incredible detective story of our client, sysadmin Sergey Tkachenko. He became a target for Kuban security forces after the war began. They monitored him for over a year, repeatedly summoned him for interrogations, hacked all his devices, and secretly broke into his apartment, possibly spying on him through his boss at work.

Usually, such stories are revealed too late, when the person is already arrested and sent to a detention center. But Tkachenko got lucky: he managed to decipher the plans of the special services, quickly adapted, and, thanks to his resourcefulness (and the help of lawyers from “The First Department”), managed to leave the country at the last moment. We’ll share how the special services conducted this operation, who was involved, the methods they used, and what it was likely planned for. Get comfortable and tune in — you won’t find such detailed insights into the work of security forces anywhere else!

🏆 [Secure Messenger: The Best Apps for Secret Chats](https://youtu.be/maI_Ri2ucxo)

It's time to choose a secure messenger! To ensure that neither security services nor hackers can read your messages, it needs to meet several criteria. First and foremost, it should support end-to-end encryption. Additionally, it's crucial that the messenger neither collects nor shares your data — in fact, it shouldn't have your data at all. Ideally, the app should also have open-source code so independent experts can verify the developers' integrity. It's not an easy choice.

Fortunately, we've done the work for you. We'll review the most popular messengers and then suggest safer alternatives. Spoiler alert: the most secure one isn't Telegram. Want to find out what offers even better protection? Then watch our new video!
